And the C drive\r\n    * Open xampp folder (or similar) (If you do not have an xampp folder proceed to next step)\r\n    * Open mysql/bin and paste the .sql file there.\r\n    * Execute the following commands though cmd.exe (You can run cmd.exe from Start -> Run -> cmd.exe. ENTER)\r\n\r\n```\r\n> cd c:\\xampp\\mysql\\bin\r\n// If You hdid not have a xampp folder in step 3 of above steps:\r\n// run    > cd c:\\mysql\\bin       instead.\r\n> mysql -u root\r\n// You will now see mysql prompt\r\nmysql> CREATE DATABASE 6sem;\r\nmysql> mysql -u root -p 6sem < kmcollege.sql\r\n```\r\n# When done you can now change the database and see the tables that already have been created.\r\n```\r\nmysql> use 6sem;\r\nmysql> show tables;\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe various tables can be viewed by the following command:\r\n```\r\nmysql> describe dependent;\r\nmysql> describe employee;\r\nmysql> describe works_on;\r\nmysql> describe department;\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMade with <3 by @spunkpike.
