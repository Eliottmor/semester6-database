How to Alter Constraint?? Alter or change let us say foreign key or unique constraint

Ans> You can not alter constraints ever but you can drop them and then recreate.
Have look on this

ALTER TABLE your_table DROP CONSTRAINT ACTIVEPROG_FKEY1;

and then recreate it with ON DELETE CASCADE like this

ALTER TABLE your_table
add CONSTRAINT ACTIVEPROG_FKEY1 FOREIGN KEY(ActiveProgCode) REFERENCES PROGRAM(ActiveProgCode)

 ERROR 1452 (23000): Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`final_12036282003`.`employee`, CONSTRAINT `employee_ibfk_1` FOREIGN KEY (`superssn`) REFERENCES `employee` (`ssn`))

This error is due to referential constraints. We are trying to add entries to the foreign key which references to the primary key. Since there was no record with the ssn 888665555, we got an error when adding it to the superssn. The best way that is out of this would be to have the DEFALT NULL values in the column and later update then individually.

Try,
  insert into employee
values("Franklin","T","Wong",333445555,1955-12-08,"638 Voss, Houston, TX","M",40000,DEFAULT,5);

and it works!!

Error: mysql>  alter table works_on add constraint foreign key(pno) references project(pnumber);

ERROR 1005 (HY000): Can't create table 'final_12036282003.#sql-4f5_48' (errno: 150)

When creating a foreign key constraint, MySQL requires a usable index on both the referencing table and also on the referenced table. The index on the referencing table is created automatically if one doesn't exist, but the one on the referenced table needs to be created manually (Source). Yours appears to be missing.

Test case:

CREATE TABLE tbl_a (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    some_other_id int,
    value int
) ENGINE=INNODB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.10 sec)

CREATE TABLE tbl_b (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    a_id int,
    FOREIGN KEY (a_id) REFERENCES tbl_a (some_other_id)
) ENGINE=INNODB;
ERROR 1005 (HY000): Can't create table 'e.tbl_b' (errno: 150)
But if we add an index on some_other_id:

CREATE INDEX ix_some_id ON tbl_a (some_other_id);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.11 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

CREATE TABLE tbl_b (
    id int PRIMARY KEY,
    a_id int,
    FOREIGN KEY (a_id) REFERENCES tbl_a (some_other_id)
) ENGINE=INNODB;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)
This is often not an issue in most situations, since the referenced field is often the primary key of the referenced table, and the primary key is indexed automatically.


Following the above guide, when I added the index on project(pnumber), it worked!!
mysql> create index ix_some on project(pnumber);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.17 sec)
Records: 0  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

mysql>  alter table works_on add constraint foreign key(pno) references project(pnumber);
Query OK, 16 rows affected (0.23 sec)
Records: 16  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

    Now here, the parent table is say employee and the child table is works_on table. Since works_on table has a foreign key references to primary key ssn from employee table. If we delete a record from employee table then there would be no value in the foreign key that references to primary key of the table. Hence we use cascade

    How can I add ON DELETE constraint on the table?
ans> Use ALTER TABLE+ADD CONSTRAINT. E.g. if you want to link tables members and profiles by member_id and cascade delete profiles each time the member is deleted, you can write something like this:

ALTER TABLE profiles
   ADD CONSTRAINT `fk_test`
   FOREIGN KEY (`member_id` )
   REFERENCES `members` (`member_id` )
   ON DELETE CASCADE
If you will need to update that constraint - you'll have to remove it at then create again, there's no direct way to alter it.

ALTER TABLE profiles DROP FOREIGN KEY `fk_test`

*******************************************************************************************************

How to determine the index of any foreign key or any constraint??

SHOW CREATE TABLE `works_on`;
Notice the sign around the works_on table. They are tildes not inverted commas.
^^^^ very very important ****

******************************************************************************************************
Hence solution is

-- Drop the foreign key on essn works_on referneces ssn
alter table works_on
drop foreign key works_on_ibfk_1;

-- Drop the forign key essn references dependent essn references ssn employee
    alter table dependent
drop foreign key dependent_ibfk_1;

--  Alter table to remove the constraint foreign key from department
    alter table department
drop foreign key department_ibfk_1;

-- Alter table to insert the on delete cascade option on department table
    alter table department
    add constraint department_ibfk_1
    foreign key(mgrssn) references employee(ssn)
on delete cascade;

-- Similarly apply on project table
    alter table project drop foreign key project_ibfk_1;

-- inserting on cascade on foreeign key
    alter table project add foreign key(dnum) references department(dnumber) on delete cascade;

-- Alter table to insert the on delete cascade option:
    alter table works_on add foreign key(essn) references employee(ssn) on delete cascade;

-- Alter table dependent to insert the on delete cascade option
    alter table dependent add foreign key(essn) references employee(ssn) on delete cascade;

--  Now try deleteing an entry from the parent table:
delete from employee where ssn=12345;

    ^^ It deletes
